# Association between classes occurs when a class has 
# attributes that are objects of another class. In line 
# with this concept, look at the class diagram below, which 
# represents an association where a Person owns a Car.

# ---------------                   --------------
# | Person      |                   | Car        |
# ---------------       has         --------------
# | name: str   |------------------ | brand: str |
# | age: int    |1                 1| model: str |
# | car: Car    |                   | plate: str |
# ---------------                   | year: int  |
#                                   -------------- 

# Implement the Person and Car classes.
